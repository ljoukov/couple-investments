## CoupleVest: Help Couples Agree on Investment

[AGI House: AI x Fintech Build Day](https://app.agihouse.org/events/ai-fintech-20250412)

### Problem:

- Virtually ALL couples have to manage joint finances

- Every couple we interviewed have different investment preferences
  (eg ‚Äúsingle stock‚Äù vs ‚Äúbroad strategy‚Äù)

- CoupleVest helps resolve this by:
  1 making ideas concrete:
  Uses LLM for natural language (conviction) -> maths (code) and chart

2 simulator:
Uses reasoning LLM to find similar situation in the past and historical data for simulation

### Tech

LLM is used to convert natural language ideas into code, eg:

     - ‚Äúshow me Tesla stock price in Euro‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúApple always drops after earnings‚Äù

Verifiable AI approach (aka avoid LLM for traiding, only for code<->natural language translation)

- Code is separately explained in natural language using LLM
- Code is then executed to produce charts and tables without any at runtime LLMs

## Running

Create .env file with

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
```

OpenAI is used to convert natural language into code.

FinnHub is used to load stocks prices.
